# 🎉 Branding Website for PaceMe App Industry Project Semester 7 HCD
PaceMe is an energy‑management app designed for people living with chronic conditions such as Long Covid, ME/CFS, or other energy‑limiting illnesses. This branding website serves both as an introduction for new users and as a visual and strategic brand identity handbook for stakeholders, designers, and developers.

The site brings together the core of the brand: its mission, visual identity, tone of voice, and a preview of the app experience.

## 🧠 Project Overview

This website was developed as part of the Industry Project in Semester 7 of Human Centered Design.
The goal is to establish a consistent, accessible, and human‑centered brand identity for PaceMe — an app that helps users monitor their energy, recognize patterns, and balance their daily activities more effectively.

The branding site functions as:

  -  An introduction platform for new users

  -  A brand identity guide for designers, developers, and stakeholders

  -  A visual showcase of the app and its features

---

## 🚀 Features

- Homepage with context about PaceMe, the target audience, and the mission

- Brand Identity page with color palette, logo variations, typography, and usage guidelines

- App Preview page with mockups, feature overview, and promotional video

- Responsive design for all devices

- Interactive elements such as hover animations and dynamic components

## 💡 How It Works
The website is built using static HTML pages styled with modular CSS files.
JavaScript is used for light interactions such as animations, toggles, and dynamic content.

The structure is intentionally simple so that:

  -  stakeholders can quickly understand the brand identity

  -  designers and developers can easily reuse the styles

  -  the site remains easy to expand for future iterations

## 🙌 Inspiration

This project is inspired with the help of Loveable AI and ChatGPT. 
We used the prompt:
"can you make a simple website for a personal energy management app for people with chronical ilnesses like long covid, the website should be a branding guide website that shows the font, the main color, what the app is and who they are and mockups of the app. I attached an image of how the app wil kinda look like, I just want you to give me a simple template"
