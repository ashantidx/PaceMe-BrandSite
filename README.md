## 🙌 Inspiration

This project is inspired with the help of Loveable AI and ChatGPT. 
We used the prompt:
"can you make a simple website for a personal energy management app for people with chronical ilnesses like long covid, the website should be a branding guide website that shows the font, the main color, what the app is and who they are and mockups of the app. I attached an image of how the app wil kinda look like, I just want you to give me a simple template"
